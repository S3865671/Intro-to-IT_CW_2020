       <h1> Hello World my name is Conrad Wunderlich. </h1>
     <p><img src="Profile Picture.jfif" alt="My image">
      <h3>Welcome to my very first website.</h3> 

    <h3>About me</h3>
   <p> Having always had an interests in technology and gadgets dating back to the ZX spectrum computer released in the 80's and the 1st generation iPod. 
      IT has always been more of an ongoing hobby, My early career was more business and management orientated. For the most part Information and technology has been as the end user,
    whilst trying to keep up with the trends as best I could the technology beast moves very quickly.
    My ideal Job before now was working for a Software company however recent events the next chapter is to better myself study IT.
    The reason I have selected this particular course for a better grounding and hopefully a career in Information &
    Technology sector. All of the possibilities could be considered endless when it comes to IT. Having spent time in the automotive industry it could be Inventory control using barcode scanners in spare parts or using apps to engage your current customer and potential customers

    <h3> My Ideal Job would be a Business Analyst </h3>
   <p>The Business Analyst’s primary purpose is to analyze, evaluate and refine business processes. </p>

    <h3>Personality Type's</h3>
    <p>We cannot all be the same that would be down right boring.</p>
       <p> Recently using the 16 Personalities web site to learn about my personality traits the results are in Conrad is  INTP-A - Assertive Logician.
      </p>
        <p> Want to lean more about INTP-A personality simply <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">Click Here.</a>
        </p>
   <p>The next personality test undertaken was a free version of the Myers-Briggs</p>
   <p>The results from the myer briggs test was I am ISTP- The problem solvers.
    I agree with some of this being resourceful is a strong trait to have in any situation. I am also a risk taker and like to find the results of hair brain ideas, such as you can get any where you like by car if you just turn left. Although creative is not a preferred approach if you are on a time frame.

        <p>For the 3rd online test was the 123test provided me with an accurate result with a greater insight to the traits to both sides of a personality which I found very interesting.</p>

        <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The idea for this project is an automated pet minder system customised around the humble Chicken. Backyard chickens can be a little more challenging as pet should you wish to head away for a weekend. With this project i will hopefully give Backyard Chicken owners some peace of mind that the birds that provide the houshold with eggs are looked after. With many different products on the market for Cat and Dog owners such as home monitoring and microchipping. Why should the backyard chicken which are being considered a popular backyard pet in Australia be overlooked.</p>
    <p>In a Survey of Australian Pet owners AMA Survey (2019, p.10). the average number of birds kept appears to have increased from 5.5 to 6.4 per bird-owning household, meaning there are currently an estimated 5.6 million pet birds in Australia. Caged birds remain the most popular (kept by 56% of all bird owners), followed by birds in aviaries (37%); common species include budgerigars, cockatiels, lorikeets, finches and canaries., Chickens were also kept by 28% of all bird owners.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>The saying the early bird catches the worm is very true and therefore during the summer months in Brisbane Australia daybreak is very early and backyard chicken's awakens well before i do. As keeper of backyard chicken’s they can get very restless as all they want is to escape the coup to free range. There are already solution's available with an automated door opener that is set on a timer however consider for a moment the door opens because the timer was set to early and incomes a cat or the dog that escaped their yard on the hunt for a playmate. </p>
     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>The automated pet minder system, is about backyard chicken welfare management system. By connecting a door opener to the Internet via WIFI and programming its location along with the sunrise time can mitigate the risk of predators in the morning. Fast forward to bedtime we can we apply the same principle as the morning setting sure, although could we also use technology with NFC tags and receiver to count the returning flock after a predetermined time then the door closes. Monitoring inside the interior and exterior can be done using a camera system. Utalising the exterior camera as surveillance for predators with a speaker system included to scare off the intruder. Once we have a control unit connected to the Internet there are a number of integrated systems that could be developed or addition of current technologies. One such system would anytime monitor via a smart phone application. With welfare at the forefront of this project the supply of food and water need to be considered. Unlike humans, chickens do not overeat and tend to graze all day according to their needs (Brasch,2007). For this part of the project it will be low tech with the use of a chicken feeder that is topped up as required. Now we need to consider the programming with a simple user interface both from a browser mobile app considering what method does the pet owner wish to deploy for the door opener. Option 1. The set and forget timer. Option 2. A sunlight activated trigger or Option 3. Open time set using internet weather reporting. Camera control would also need to be programmed for Interior camera set to off automatically during the day to allow for maximum solar power input to the battery, alternatively the pet owner will  have the ability to active cameras remotely via the app. For the exterior cameras motion detectors that will not only trigger the camera but also alert the owner. With many different peripherals to be taken into consideration the project is a scalable solution based on the pet owners needs.</p>
    <h3>Tools and Technology </h3>
    <p>Using a raspberry pi connected to internet as the processor the project then will require additional peripherals. The Project fore mention shall incorporate firstly a power source allowing for the possibility of a remote location somewhere in the back yard. Added to the processor will be both interior and exterior cameras including motion detector sensor. As for the predator deterrent device there are many ideas ranging from a speaker the pet owner can scare the offender thru to using an automated sprinkler system.</p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
   <p>Most of the tech is already available so the skills required will be more about programming the processer and using a web page and app for control. The programming would need to consider inputs from the internet coupled with triggers from sensors and required action. The web and app would allow human activation as required should an alert come up. As there are many smartphone programming platforms this would be one of final programming tasks undertaken.</p> 
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Will this solution be appropriate for every backyard chicken owner ? </p>
    <p>  In short possible not, however as technology progresses does a project like this dose not need to be just for backyard chickens. Currently there are many products on the market for home security and baby monitoring. Even if this is not commercially viable it shall provide myself with some peace of mind based on my circumstance. </p>
