    <h2>Firstly who am I</h2>
 
    <p>
        Hello World this is the profile for Conrad Wunderlich from Brisbane Queensland.


    <h2>My Interests</h2>
   <p> Having always had an interest in Tech and Gadgets right from the 1st generation iPod. It was always more of a hobby
    as early in my career I was more business and management orientated. Mostly IT has been as an end user of technology
    whilst trying to keep up with the trends as best I could.
    My ideal Job would be working for a Software company in database management and programming hopefully choosing RMIT
    will set me on the right path.
    The reason I am doing this course is to get a better grounding and hopefully continue a career in Information and
    Technology sector. As the possibilities are almost endless with IT whether it is Inventory control via scanners,
    CRM, Mobile Apps, Social networking </p>
